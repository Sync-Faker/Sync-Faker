`Paper: Not Only Location, But Also Perception: Disturb Fusion-based Perception System on Autonomous Driving Through GPS Spoofing`
## Abstract
  In the rapidly advancing field of autonomous driving (AV), ensuring the security of multi-sensor fusion (MSF) perception is critical for self-driving vehicles' safe and reliable operation. Although previous studies have thoroughly explored the vulnerabilities of these systems, they primarily focused on the algorithms themselves, without considering their security within the broader context of AV systems. Additionally, these studies often rely on strong assumptions or complex attack scenarios, which limit their applicability in real-world environments. Motivated by these gaps, this paper presents a novel attack pipeline named \textit{Sync-Faker} that leverages GPS time spoofing to disrupt the synchronization of sensor data, leading to misalignment and erroneous perception outcomes.
  We validate the feasibility of this attack using a production-grade autonomous driving platform and further assess the impact on multiple perception tasks using publicly available datasets. Our approach demonstrates that manipulating a GPS-based synchronization system makes it possible to degrade the performance of camera-LiDAR fusion systems, ultimately compromising the vehicle's ability to detect and respond to obstacles accurately. In response to these findings, we also propose potential defense strategies, including improved synchronization mechanisms and GPS spoofing defense, to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. This work not only fills a crucial research gap by examining the security of MSF systems in a practical context but also offers insights to strengthen autonomous vehicles against emerging threats.
